; In addition to map and filter there are several other useful abstract
; list functions built into ISL.  These are listed on the Language page
; of the course web site. Examples of their use are shown below:


(check-expect (map positive? (list 1 -2 3 -4)) (list true false true false))

(check-expect (filter negative? (list 1 -2 3 -4)) (list -2 -4))

(check-expect (foldr + 0 (list 1 2 3)) (+ 1 2 3 0))   ;foldr is abstraction
(check-expect (foldr * 1 (list 1 2 3)) (* 1 2 3 1))   ;of sum and product


(check-expect (build-list 6 identity) (list 0 1 2 3 4 5))

(check-expect (build-list 4 sqr) (list 0 1 4 9))

; PROBLEM:
;
; Complete the design of the following functions by coding them using a
; built-in abstract list function.


;; (listof Image) -> (listof Image)
;; produce list of only those images that are wide?
(check-expect (wide-only (list I1 I2 I3 I4 I5)) (list I2 I4))

;(define (wide-only loi) empty) ;stub

#;
(define (wide-only loi) ;template
  (filter ... loi))

(define (wide-only loi)
  (filter wide? loi))


;; (listof Image) -> Boolean
;; are all the images in loi tall?
(check-expect (all-tall? LOI1) #f)
(check-expect (all-tall? (list I1 I3)) #t)

;(define (all-tall? loi) false) ;stub

(define (all-tall? loi)
  (andmap tall? loi))

;; (listof Number) -> Number
;; sum the elements of a list
(check-expect (sum (list 1 2 3 4)) 10)

;(define (sum lon) 0) ;stub
(define (sum lon)
  (foldr + 0 lon))


;; Natural -> Natural
;; produce the sum of the first n natural numbers
(check-expect (sum-to 3) (+ 0 1 2))

;(define (sum-to n) 0) ;stub

;(define (sum-to n) ;template
;  (foldr <fn> <base> (build-list n <some fn>)))

(define (sum-to n)
  (foldr + 0 (build-list n identity)))
