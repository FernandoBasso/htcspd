= README - How to Code - Systematic Program Design

My studies and solutions for the course https://www.edx.org/xseries/how-code-systematic-program-design[How To Code — Systematic Program Design at EDX].

Source files and commits should start with a “tag” like:

- vd: (code from video)
- qa: (code from questions and answers)
- pp: (code from practice problems)

Other commits like those to change readme or add images or any other case don't need tags.
