; Imagine that you are designing a program to manage ticket sales for a

;
; Design a data definition to represent a seat number in a row, where each
; row has 32 seats. (Just the seat number, not the row number.)

;; SeatNum is Natural[1, 30]
;; Interp: seat numbers in a row, 1 and 32 are aisle seats.
(define SN1 1)    ; aisle
(define SN2 12)   ; middle
(define SN3 32)   ; aisle

;; Template rules used:
