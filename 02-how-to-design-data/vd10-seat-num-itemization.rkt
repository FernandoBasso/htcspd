;
; Consider designing the system for controlling a New Year's Eve
; display. Design a data definition to represent the current state of
; the countdown, which falls into one of three categories:
;
;   - not yet started;
;   - from 10 to 1 seconds before midnight;
;   - complete (Happy New Year!)
;

;; CountDown is one of:
;;  - #false
;;  - Natural[1, 10]
;;  - "complete"
;; Interp:
;;  - #false:         means countdown has not yet started;
;;  - Natural[1, 10]: means countdown is running and how many seconds left;
;;  - "complete":     means countdown is over;
(define CD1 #false)
(define CD2 10)   ; just started running
(define CD3 1)    ; almost over
(define CD4 "complete")

(define (fn-for-countdown c)
  (cond [(false? c) (...)]
        [(and (number? c) (<= 1 c) (<= c 10)) (... c)]
        [(number? c) (... c)]
        [else (...)]))

;; Template rules used:
;;  - one of: 3 cases:
;;    - atomic distinct: #false
;;    - atomic non-distint: Natural[1, 10]
;;    - atomic distinct: "complete"
